# Simple-Calculator

*A __calculator__ is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only __addition__, __subtraction__, __multiplication__, and __division__.
So keeping this in the mind, I created a __'simple calculator'__ by using the very __basic__ concept of __Python__. I made this calculator to implement my basic coding to build a real-life solving problem program .i.e., __Simple-Caculator__*
